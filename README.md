# Scale and Risk: Global Tuberculosis Analysis (Tableau Project)

## Overview
This project uses Tableau to analyze global tuberculosis (TB) incidence and explore
how disease risk varies by population scale and healthcare resource availability
across countries.

## My Role
- Designed Tableau dashboards and visualizations
- Performed country-level comparative analysis
- Interpreted insights and contributed to the final report

## Data Sources
- WHO Global Tuberculosis Database
- World Bank population and healthcare indicators

## Dashboard

## Key Insights
- TB incidence varies significantly when normalized by population
- High-burden countries show clustering patterns by resource availability
- Visualization reveals regional under-reporting risks

## Deliverables
- 📄 Final analytical report (PDF)
- 📄 Presentation slides (PDF)

## Tools
